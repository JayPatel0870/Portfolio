I am Jay Patel, a passionate and results-driven data scientist and software developer with a strong foundation in computer science and extensive hands-on experience in data analytics, backend development, and AI-driven projects. With a Master’s degree in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Arlington and a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering from LDRP Institute of Technology Research, I have developed a comprehensive skill set that spans various programming languages, frameworks, and technologies.
</p><p class="padded-paragraph">
During my tenure as a Data Science and Business Analytics Intern at The Sparks Foundation, I honed my skills in data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and model validation, significantly improving data accuracy and model efficiency. My work involved orchestrating the cleaning of over 100,000 records daily using Python and SQL, and analyzing over 500,000 data points with tools like Pandas and Scikit-learn. These efforts led to a notable enhancement in data accuracy and model performance.
</p><p class="padded-paragraph">
In my role as a Backend Developer Intern at Roxon Technologies, I spearheaded database optimizations and implemented CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins, resulting in a 50% improvement in website search speed and a smoother user experience. I maintained RESTful APIs and collaborated closely with the front-end team using Agile methodologies, which led to a significant increase in website traffic and property listings.
</p><p class="padded-paragraph">
I have also worked on several impactful projects, including developing an AI-powered Q&A chatbot utilizing LangChain’s CSV Loader class and Google PaLM to enhance NLP functions, and creating an emotion recognition system using OpenCV and neural networks. These projects have not only demonstrated my ability to apply machine learning techniques to real-world problems but also my capability to improve user engagement and satisfaction.
</p><p class="padded-paragraph">
In addition to my professional experience, I have developed robust applications such as a full-stack web platform for film database management, a quiz application with efficient backend infrastructure, and a multi-threaded web crawler optimized for performance. These projects highlight my proficiency in Java, Spring Boot, and advanced concurrency APIs, showcasing my ability to design and implement scalable, high-performance systems.
</p><p class="padded-paragraph">
I am proficient in a wide array of programming languages and frameworks including Python, Java, C++, Django, and Spring Boot, and I am well-versed in tools like Docker, Jenkins, and various IDEs. My dedication to continuous learning is evident from my certifications in Python and Data Science from Google and IBM, respectively.
</p><p class="padded-paragraph">
I am eager to leverage my expertise in data science and software development to contribute to innovative projects and drive impactful solutions. My commitment to excellence and my ability to adapt and thrive in fast-paced environments make me a valuable asset to any team.
